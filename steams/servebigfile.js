// Hereâ€™s a simple Node web server designed to exclusively serve the big.file:

const fs = require('fs');
const server = require('http').createServer();

server.on('request', (req, res) => {
    fs.readFile('big.file', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }

        res.end(data);
    });
});

/*
We basically put the whole big.file content in memory before we wrote it out to
the response object. This is very inefficient.

The HTTP response object (res in the code above) is also a writable stream. This
means if we have a readable stream that represents the content of big.file, we
can just pipe those two on each other and achieve mostly the same result without
consuming ~400 MB of memory.
